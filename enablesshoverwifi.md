However second point needs some corrections:

1. Switch to diagnostic mode, by adding an empty file "ENABLE_DIAGS" to usb root. Do not disconnect USB Cable
2. Restart from menu service menu and still on kindle:
3. In Diagnostic Mode go to
3.1 Misc individual diagnostics
3.2 Utilities
3.3 Enable USBnet and exit with the ->
4. On your linux terminal enable usbnetwork (check with ifconfig or dmesg new network device, for me it was enp0s20u6)
5. and follow the steps:
5.1 `sudo ifconfig enp0s20u6 192.168.15.2 netmask 255.255.255.0`
5.2 `ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 root@192.168.15.244`
5.3 Login to kindle with a password generated by https://www.sven.de/kindle/ or your own if you have already changed and follow this steps
5.4 `mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/base-mmc/`
5.5 add to `/mnt/base-mmc/etc/sysconfig/iptables`
       `-A INPUT -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT` just before the final `COMMIT` Like this:

```bash
# ICMP. Allow only responses to local connections
-A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# Kindle SSH rule
-A INPUT -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
COMMIT
```

   5.6 Copy SSH host keys: `cp -a /etc/dropbear /mnt/base-mmc/etc`
   5.7 Check if dropbear init file exists `/mnt/base-mmc/etc/init.d/dropbear`, if not create it with the content of:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

_FUNCTIONS=/etc/rc.d/functions
[ -f ${_FUNCTIONS} ] && . ${_FUNCTIONS}

case "$1" in
start)

/usr/local/sbin/dropbear
;;

*)
msg "usage: /etc/init.d/$NAME {start}" W >&2
exit 1
;;

esac

exit 0
```

   5.8 Make it executable: `chmod 755 /mnt/base-mmc/etc/init.d/dropbear`
   5.9 Start it in the 5th init level by: `ln -s /etc/init.d/dropbear /mnt/base-mmc/etc/rc5.d/S99dropbear`
   5.10 `sync`, ` umount /mnt/base-mmc`and on kindle from main diagnostic menu go to Exit, Reboot or Disable Diags, disable Diag and confirmed with "<-" key.

Disconnect from USB, ssh over WiFi shall be ready.
